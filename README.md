# dotfiles

This repository is to manage "dot" files.

I wrote how to setup and what is installed on Qiita in Japanese.

## Usage

You first should clone this repository with recursive option.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/touyou/dotfiles.git --recursive
```

And then, run them.

```sh
$ cd (cloned place)
$ ./install_dotfiles
```

But these are only setting files.
So install and setup apps you need in the first time.
